# A Quick Guide for the Impatient

You need a quick solution for an urgent problem? Here’s how to find the most relevant topics for your needs.

I haven’t separated advice by productivity or health, since the two are closely linked.

## I don’t want to spend money; I just want to type faster and more ergonomically

Start by installing and learning the Colemak keyboard layout. In a few weeks you will type faster and feel more relaxed.

For even better results, consider investing in a mechanical keyboard. You won’t regret spending around 100 USD.

## I don’t want to learn another keyboard layout, but I’m ready to spend some money

Buy a mechanical keyboard. Depending on your needs, a compact - such as the 40% ortholinear Planck keyboard with 4 × 12 grid layout - or a split keyboard could be especially helpful. Just make sure to choose the right switches.

That said, learning Colemak will additionally improve both your ergonomics and typing speed.

## I want to type really fast!

Switching to a layout like Dvorak or Colemak can roughly double your typing speed (50–100 words per minute is realistic).

For captioning in real-time (CART) at 200+ words per minute, look into stenography. There are specialized keyboards and software (such as Plover) designed for this purpose.

## I want to improve my productivity

Minimize mouse use - Constantly switching between keyboard and mouse use is a huge productivity killer. Controlling your software via keyboard is far more efficient. There are editors, browser plugins, and other tools that make keyboard-centric work seamless.

## I have a serious hand injury. How can I keep working?

First, consult your doctor. Depending on the severity, dictation software and a custom split mechanical keyboard tailored to your requirements may help. The book covers a range of possibilities, from auto-shift to one-handed typing.

Feel free to reach out with questions. Good luck!

## I’m a gamer/programmer and want the best keyboard on Earth!

Head to the hardware sections and explore programming your keyboard with QMK. Building and testing different keyboards can be both practical and fun!
