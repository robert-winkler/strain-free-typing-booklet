# A quick guide for the inpatient

OK. You need a quick solution for an urgent problem? I'll try to hint you to the sections of the book which are most relevant for your case.

I did not classify for increased productivity or health aspects, since they are correlated.

## I don't want to spend money; I just want to type faster and more ergonomically

Easy. Install and learn the Colemak keyboard layout (see section \ref{section-alternative-keyboard-layouts}, page \pageref{section-alternative-keyboard-layouts}).

However, consider in addition to buy a mechanical keyboard. You won't regret the investment of about 100 USD.

## I don't want to learn another keyboard layout, but I'm ready to spend some money

Get a mechanical keyboard. Depending on your motivation, a keyboard with reduced size or a split keyboard might be helpful. Make sure buying the correct switches (see page \pageref{switches}).

Anyway, learning Colemak would further improve ergonomic and fast typing.

## I want to type really fast!

With a suitable keyboard layout such as Dvorak or Colemak you can roughly double your typing speed (50-100 words per minute are realistic); again, see section \ref{section-alternative-keyboard-layouts}, page \pageref{section-alternative-keyboard-layouts}.

For captioning in real-time (CART), with 200+ words per minute, you should learn Stenography. Suitable keyboards and software (Plover) are covered in section xx, page xx.

## I want to improve my productivity

Use the keyboard for controlling your software, instead of the mouse, because constantly switching between keyboard and mouse is a huge productivity killer. Section xx presents editors, browser plugins etc. for keyboard-centric work.

## I got a serious health problem with my hands. How can I continue working?

See you medical doctor. However, depending on severity, I would go for dictation and a custom-made split mechanical keyboard programmed for your needs. Read all the sections; they will give you some ideas of what is possible (e g. auto-shift, one-handed typing etc ).

Write me in case of questions. Good luck!

## I'm a gamer/ programmer and want the optimal keyboard!

Get to the hardware sections xx and program the keyboard with QMK (section xx). Build different keyboards and have fun!
