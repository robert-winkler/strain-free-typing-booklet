# My Personal Motivation

As a scientist, I write constantly: articles, book chapters, research proposals, emails, and project reports. Unfortunately, after losing mobility in my left index finger due to an accident (a reminder: always use a bottle opener!), typing soon caused pain throughout my hand.  

Prolonged work or gaming with an unsuitable keyboard setup will eventually lead to health issues, such as repetitive strain injury (RSI), and reduced productivity. It’s essential to analyze potential risks and optimize our workspace.  

After testing alternative keyboards and typing software, I discovered that the current "standard" setups are surprisingly poor—and better alternatives are available at little or no cost.  

A mechanical keyboard (technically electronic but using physical spring mechanisms) with suitable switches immediately relieves hand strain. Ideally, the keyboard should also feature improved geometry, such as a compact size and an ortholinear layout. Today, keyboards can be customized to fit individual needs, including split designs for a more natural hand position and switches with soft springs for lighter keystrokes. Smaller keyboards also minimize finger and hand movements, such as reaching for the mouse.  

Switching from QWERTY to Colemak makes typing more ergonomic and, after some practice, can even double your typing speed. It also supports multilingual typing and programming.  

But QWERTY is just one of many outdated aspects of modern keyboards. For example, it’s absurd that we still simulate shifting a typewriter’s mechanism to capitalize letters—especially since we perform this frequent action with our weakest fingers, the pinkies, which must stretch awkwardly to reach the 'shift' keys on large keyboards. In contrast, programmable keyboards with auto-shift can capitalize letters when a key is held slightly longer.
This guide helps readers choose the right typing strategy—whether for professional writers, gamers, programmers, accountants, or those with health issues like RSI—by exploring keyboards, layouts, and software.  

I also cover building and programming custom keyboards, from selecting designs and components to configuring keymap layouts and special features like OLED displays. Additionally, I introduce stenography for ultra-fast typing and software for mouse-free workflows.  

Custom keyboards don’t have to be expensive: a split mechanical keyboard can be built for $100–200, is fully repairable, and promotes ergonomic, productive, and sustainable typing.
