# My personal motivation

As a scientist, I need to write a lot: Articles, book chapters, research proposals, emails, project reports, etc. Unfortunately, I lost my left index finger mobility after an accident (remember: always use a bottle opener!), which soon caused pain in the whole hand while typing.  

Prolonged working/gaming with an unsuitable keyboard set-up will lead sooner or later to health problems, such as an repetitive stain injury (RSI) and consequently to reduced productivity. Thus, we should analyze possible risks and optimize our environment.

Testing alternative keyboards and typing software, I found that the current 'standard' set-ups are really bad, and alternatives are available for no or little money. 

A mechanical keyboard (in fact, the keyboards are electronic, but use a physical spring mechanism) with suitable switches immediately results in a releave for the hands. Ideally, the keyboard also improved geometry, such as reduced size, and an ortholinear layout. Nowadays, the design and components of keyboards can be adapted to the individual user. E.g., split keyboards for a more natural hand position and switches with soft springs for lighter pressing. In addition, tiny keyboards minimize finger and hand movements, such as reaching the mouse.

Simply changing the keymap layout from QWERTY to Colemak makes writing more ergonomic, and after some training, doubles the writing speed. Besides, multilingual typing and programming are supported. 

But the QWERTY layout is only one anachronism of current keyboards. For example, it is absurd that we still simulate shifting an old typewriter's mechanic to capitalize a letter. Even worse, we do this frequent movement with our weakest fingers, the 'pinkies,' that need to be stretched on large keyboards for reaching the 'shift' keys. In contrast, a keyboard with programmable auto-shift capitalizes letters if the user presses the key just slightly longer.  

 
This guide helps choose a suitable typing strategy (keyboard, layout, software, etc.) for different users like professional writers, gamers, programmers, accountants, and people with health problems, including repetitive strain injury (RSI).

As well, I introduce the building and programming of custom keyboards, including choosing a suitable design and components, keymap layouts, and special features such as OLED displays. Also, stenography is introduced, allowing typing with very high speed, and software for mouse-free working.  

Personal-fit keyboards are not expensive; a split keyboard with mechanical switches can be built for 100-200 USD and is repairable, and therefore contributes to ergonomic and productive typing, and sustainability.
