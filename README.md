A pocket‑size guide covering mechanical keyboards, ergonomics, and stenography.

## mdBook: HTML, PDF, and epub creation
If you are lucky (i.e. the compilation on the GitHub repository worked), you can browse the current version of the booklet on: 
<https://robert-winkler.github.io/strain-free-typing-booklet/>

You can build the PDF and epub versions locally, using
~~~
mdbook build
~~~
within the cloned repository.

Of course, you need `mdbook`, and `mdbook-pandoc` installed, as well as their dependencies.
